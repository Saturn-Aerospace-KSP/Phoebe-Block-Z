## User Guide: 
### Part Tags
To ensure that the software will work correctly, please visit the "SaturnAerospace/Phoebe/Partlist.ks" file and make sure that your craft has the same files
You must right click the corresponding part in the VAB and set the kOS nametag to be identical to the value on the right of each list, e.g. "CPU", "S1_CPU" - You would use the part tag **S1_CPU**.

For ease of use, **2 crafts have been provided with the correct part tags!**

### Mission Settings
Then you must configure the mission settings and use the correct launch site, e.g. Tundra pad 40 erector for CCSFS 40 etc.
Also you will have to choose the correct vehicle configuration for the mission.
